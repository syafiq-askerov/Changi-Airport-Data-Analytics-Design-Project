# Syafiq Bashir's Design Project

This reposistory consists of contents from Syafiq's design project.

**Design project:** Developing an Analytics Interface for Changi Airport by utilising the ELK stack.

The interfaces are displayed on dashboards through usage of an open source data visualization tool called Kibana.

## Dashboard One 


Analysis of Changi Airport Passengers and Air Cargo data. Data displayed in Dashboard one are authentic as datasets are obtained from public data portal in csv format.

One example of datasets taken are from:
https://data.gov.sg/dataset/air-passenger-arrivals-total-by-region-and-selected-country-of-embarkation?resource_id=efd7b75b-992e-4221-aff3-c57140af1f67


The purpose of Dashboard one would be to would be to provide analysis of large datasets through a simple interface. An example would be  querying for countries where air cargo loaded is above 10000kg.

## Dashboard Two

Analysis of Changi Airport Airline data.Data displayed in Dashboard Two are artificial as datasets ware obtained from developing a server log generation program in Java.

The purpose of Dashboard Two would be to simulate analysis of data from a server as datasets are generated in near "Real-Time". The dashboard visuals here will display some indictors if data anlaysed exceed a certain threshold that has been set. An example would be in the event of sudden large amount of flight delays, indicators would be displayed within Dashboard Two.
